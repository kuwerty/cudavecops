CUDA Vector Operators
=====================

Current state: probably doesn't even compile correctly yet.

Sometimes you just want to do basic operations on CUDA's builtin vector types.

This is a header file providing basic operator overloads for builtin vectors. It allows you to write expression such as:

float4 a ...
float4 b ...
float4 c = a * b

The operands can be be a mix of vector or scalar quantities.

It's similar to what you'd get from OpenCL.

The header file is generated from a Ruby script, don't modify the header directly.
